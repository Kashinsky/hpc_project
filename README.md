Description: 
    This is a project to create a working Checkers AI using genetic algorithms and parallel processing.
    More information on this will be added in the future.

Backlog: 
    This is the backlog for the hpc project. The log is subject to change and is very vague.

    [X] Get Github working for us.

    [ ] Research into Checkers ai.

    [ ] Research into genetic algorithms specific to Checkers

    [ ] Determine methods for finding a fitness.

    [ ] Write code for running small checkers games between ais.

    [ ] Find ways of encoding a genetic algorithm for Checkers.

    [ ] Write code for ai using genetic algorithm practices.

    [ ] Run code and analyze its aspects as well as comparing their success against the fitness.
